# SeeFood
SeeFood is a Swift app that uses a convolutional neural network to identify hotdogs.

SeeFood uses Apple's new machine learning library [CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/core-ml/.)
## History
SeeFood was an app I decided to build after watching [Jian Yang's app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIci3C4JkL0) from the HBO Silicon Valley show.
